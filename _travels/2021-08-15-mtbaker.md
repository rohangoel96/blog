description: Another active glacier-covered volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, Mount Baker is one of the snowiest places in the world. And now that summer if almost ending and with all the snow melted, we felt safe to go and do a hike in the area.

End of summer season also leads to a lots of forest fires but lucky for us that Mt Baker was completely clear of any smoke!
|
We started our journey at Heather Meadows - a fantastic subalpine wildflower displays with heather and huckleberry meadows that roll for miles 
|
Lava flows from Mount Baker have resisted glacial carving and columns of andesite stand like black anvils against the sky
|
Posing in the Heather Meadows
|
Winding Mount Baker Highway and State route 542 still yet to open after the snow-melt!
|
It''s spring in Mt Baker Wilderness, with backdrop of Mt Shukshan
|
Finally gaining some height ...
|
 ... to reach artists point and get first views of Mt. Baker.
|
Posing for a fake candid with Baker which has just been a tease so far.
|
Hence we decided to flex some muscles and go all the way to Table Mountain which is not for the faint-hearted!
|
!!GIF!! Part of the way up the trail you are literally doing a catwalk on the side of a cliff
|
But reaching the top is highly rewarding and the plateau offers awesome view of Shuksan and Baker.
|
Finally reaching a good vantage point to get clear views of the glorious Mt Baker - the MVP of the hike!
|
And not to be taken lightly and infact a grand sight to behold is one of the worlds most photographed mountains - Shukshan.
|
Random Ice Sheet?!
|
Ugh! Shorts + No Sunscreen + Rare PNW Sunny Day = Recipe for disaster :)
|
Pitstop to relax for a while and probably clear off some tan?
