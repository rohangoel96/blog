<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/cover_min.jpg" alt="">Work on Gaudi's last project, the super chruch: @SagradaFamília started in 1882 but it's still largely unfinished. Being privately financed, majorly by entry ticket contributions, it is stipulated to be finished in 2026.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/1_min.jpg">Interior of the Sagarada Familia. Paul Goldberger describes it as "the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages".</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/2_min.jpg">Amidst the protest of a "Independant Catalonia" it probably wasn't the best time to visit this part of the country. But what is life without risks, no?<br><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/catalonia-march-barcelona-leaders-referendum-release-1.4399182" target="_blank">This</a> happened the same night we reached :)</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/5_min.jpg">That awkward moment when there are protests going on just 100m away from you and all you care about are the pigeons :P. @PlacaDeCatalunya

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/3_min.jpg">The La Boqueria market is one the most exotic food market I have ever witnessed. There is literally no end to the variety of stuff you can have here. SURREAL!!</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/4_min.jpg">Never knew we had this many types (and colors) of eggs :O</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/6_min.jpg">The Columbus Monument: contructed in honor of his first voyage to the Americas</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/7_min.jpg">The Magic Fountain of Montjuïc. Was too good to be free :P</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/8_min.jpg">When the planning didn't go well (plus you're broke off the EuroTour) and you have no place to sleep for the night but the warm underground metro station. Definitely a heck of an adventure.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/9_min.jpg">The good part: you wake up early and witness the beautiful sunset. :)</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/11-barcelona/10_min.jpg">Believe it or not, this pic wasn't posed for. 100% candid</p>
