So here comes another internship (Bachelor's Thesis) and another country. It's continental Europe and SOUTH OF FRANCE this time. Montpellier is on the Mediterranean coast experiences a much warmer climate than rest of France (thank god!). It's a student city with more than a third of the popuation being students. And yes, I don't know French so it's hell of a problem.
