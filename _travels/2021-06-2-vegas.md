description: Set in the middle of the Mojave desert of Nevada, Las Vegas- the Entertainment Capital of the World, can seem unreal at first sight - it is a prime example of man's stubbornness to build this mammoth of a city in super inhospitable environment.  Nicknamed Sin City, Las Vegas and its surrounding communities are famed for their mega-casino resorts, often lavishly decorated with names and themes meant to evoke romance, mystery, and exotic destinations

The infamous brightly-lit Strip passes through the center of the city, where on can find all manner of amusements and entertainment: circuses, stage shows, thrill rides, erotica, exotic animals, fine dining restaurants, nightclubs, shopping, and elaborate fountain displays, to say nothing of the age-old allure of gambling and drinking.

Founded in 1905, compared with other American cities, even those in the western United States, Las Vegas is a relatively recent arrival. So before visiting the city itself, we headed to the place partly responsible for it''s success ...
|
.... the hoover dam was the world''s tallest dam when it was built. An architectural marvel, the dam  impounds Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States by volume!
|
Mike Oâ€™Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge measures 1,905 feet long and soars nearly 900 feet above the Colorado River, making it the longest single-span concrete arch bridge in the Western Hemisphere as well as the second-highest bridge of any type in America.
|
Vegas doesn''t feel like Vegas without the beautiful cacophony of slot machines and roulette wheels.
|
About eight in ten (81%) visitors gamble while in Las Vegas, the highest proportion in the past five years, so how can we defy the trend?
|
I''ve been to a couple of casino''s before Vegas too, but the extravagance and the opulence here is just unparalled.
|
Just look at the interiors?
|
Heck we even had our dinner next to the slot machines - can it get more Vegas?

<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">The Fountains of Bellagio express the romantic spirit of the resort.</p></p>
|
Finally we started our ''Casino Hopping'' starting for the heart of the strip - Bellagio, which is built into an Italian theme.
|
The second stop in the hopping was the (Disney?) castle themed Excalibur and has been featured in several video game and television productions.
|
With the pyramid and sphinx facade, the Luxor Sky Beam is the strongest beam of light in the world!! So much for a casino?
|
Did we get transported to	Ancient Egypt here?
|
How can one miss Venetian - the world''s second-largest hotel, with all the gondolas?
|
Oh, haven''t seen IRL yet, but I did get a glimpse of New York City skyline too here. Thanks Vegas!
|
Ah, and here is an opulent facility that gave guests a sense of life during the Roman Empire.
|
Caesar''s palace is known as a reco-Roman fantasyland featuring marble reproductions of classical statuary and has been a site of multiple movies like Hangover, Iron Man, etc.
|
Need to look for directions since the casino just so big?
|
Didn''t quite understand the signs so casually asking the first Roman emperor, Augustus Caesar about the directions
|
And finally vibing in Paris to complete our hopping.
|
Get sloshed in Paris and Vegas at the same time. Check!
|
!!GIF!! Ah, few hours earlier with oversized drinks x_x
|
Wannabe Limo ride to ...
|
.... the World''s Largest Gentlemen''s Club
|
Ssssh... what happens here, only happens here and also just stays here :P
