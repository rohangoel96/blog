description: Rattlesnake ledge trail is one of the most popular hiking trails in Seattle and it is perfect for as a Seattle day hike. Not a sunny day, but we really wanted to do a hike and Rattlesnake ledge hike is a great cloudy day hike with possibilities to see cloud inversion if lucky!

Just as we arrive at the trailhead we saw the view of Rattlesnake Ledge''s sheer rock face hiding amongst the clouds across Rattlesnake Lake.

Famously called "greeter" boulder, welcomes you as you start the hike!
|
As we climbed up, the fog started to set in and we found ourselves amongst clouds and long moss covered trees!
|
Wallpaper material?
|
Nice view of Rattlesnake Lake from the Rattlesnake ledge. I would definitely want to come back on a sunny/ clear day here haha!
|
Above the clouds, lol?
