Probably the last outing when everyone from "Killogicals" together. We decided to go to Fisherman's Wharf - the famous authentic Goan cuisine restaurant chain.

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/1-goa/1.jpg" alt="">The best plate of Nachos that I have ever eaten. <br>The rest of the food was probably so delicious that we forgot to take the pics :P</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/1-goa/2.jpg" alt="">Any sort of words with my limited vocab would demean the importance of these people</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/1-goa/3.jpg" alt="">We, the fishermans are at our wharf - need to take a pic with our boat! Obviously!</p>
