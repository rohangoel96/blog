description: The first semester is coming to an end - everyone is busy studying with the campus being deserted. But luckily, I don't have exams this semester - giving me the perfect opportunity to capture pictures of the campus with minimal disturbance by other creatures.

This terrific frame had always been occluded by the trees. But with winter setting in, it gives one the perfect opportunity to click this! GT was founded in 1885, as a trade school and the school''s site once held fortifications to protect Atlanta during the American Civil War.

Not a lot of people know but GT was the site of <a href="https://www.news.gatech.edu/2012/07/24/georgia-tech-selected-location-%E2%80%9C-internship%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">shooting of film "The Internship"</a> and the Clough Undegraduate Learning Commons (CULC) was staged up as Google Plex.

The rooftop garden at CULC
|
View of Bank of America Plaza, the tallest building in any U.S. state capital from campus.
|
Huge Classrooms (or lecture "theatres") at GT
|
Joke by the coke!
|
Deserted
|

|
Although expensive to live in Midtown, it sure does has it''s views.
|
Supposed to be a de-stressing time, but even with exams, being in the vicinity of dogs is super stressful for me!
|
Could make no sense of American Football but the scenery sure is cool!
|
Basketball at one of the most beautiful indoor stadiums - McCaimish!
|
I guess I''ll experience every sport here on campus! Volleyball this time
|
National Junior Swimming Championship at CRC - the site of 1996 Olympics.
|
Celebrating and learning about Thanksgiving with @RichaTibrewal @ArthitaGhosh @KathanKashiparekh @ShaliniChaudhuri and our graceful hosts ..
|
...along with the FEAST!
|
The affluent 5th street on campus!
|
Coda serves as the pinnacle of innovation for Midtown Atlanta''s Tech Square...
|
...and also flaunts the world''s tallest spiral staircase along with TWIN elevators - two cars operating independently in one shaft!
|
And ofcourse offers a surreal view of Midtown!
|
Oh did I mention about the free bowling arena on campus? @ManasSahni
