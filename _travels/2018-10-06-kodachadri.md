description: After being postponed a hundred times and amid the risk of a cyclone, we the "fresh graduates" at Tesco Bengaluru set our minds to scale the Kodachadri Hill. The Kodachadri trek is probably one of the best treks in the Western Ghats which offers a 16km one-way hike, flat grasslands, waterfalls, jeep ride and the amazing view of the Arabian Sea - all wonderfully packed in one adventure.

Chosing to go just after the monsoon is probably one the best decisions since you can witness the flora in its full glory.
|
After reaching the base, we started the trek half tired due to the not-so-comfortable traveller ride from Bangalore. 
|
Starting the journey with "Introductions" - amongst people you already know from over 3 months?
|
Now this treks offers you all sort of vegetation - passing through the dense rain forests - something typical in western ghats ...
|
and then sudden flat meadows and vast empty lands ...
|
with the mandatory leech filled streams.
|
Hidlumane waterfalls is aptly places after covering approximately half the distance ...
|
which gave us the opportunity to relax and refresh ourselves.
|
Continuing our almost perpendicular trek
|
SRK fans regroup in the paddy fields
|
For the amazing cloud formation and weird overlapping socks and cargo for avoiding leech bites.
|
Serene view of the greenery and the backwaters
|
Living off the edge :O
|
Pondering if it''s worth the effort to trek further
|
The all so dangerous jeep trails where a random jeeps can come from any direction with the sole motive to overrun you.
|
The moment of elation when it''s the last leg and you can see the beautiful summit.
|
Owing to the clear skies, we were luckily able to see the vast Arabian Sea from the top - seems like a gift from god with the picturesque sunrays.
|
Post dinner games after returning from the super adventurous jeep ride back to the homestay, starting from the cliff.
|
Nagara fort and sore legs on the following day
|
The fort is built on a small hill, beside a lake ..
|
.. which adds on to the beauty
