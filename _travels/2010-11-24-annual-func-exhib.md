description:  Our beloved school extravagantly organizes a cultural function and exhibition annually with participation of more than 2000 students (*coughs* mandatory 100% participation *coughs*)

my_arr: '
And this occurance was a special one with the 30 year anniversary special, coupled with us being the 8th standard, which was probably the most fun times.
|
For the exhibition whole of the school is converted into a art-exhibition, with basketball court, football fields, classrooms, corridors giving space to various art forms.
|
To felicitate the economic weaker section of the society, this exhibition a model of a village was erected ..
|
 ... which gave some of us an opportunity (to fake and) try hookhas.
|
Ofcourse, what''s an exhibition without the highlight for us:  IT EXHIBITION
|
which was managed by us, the IT Team of school. <br> @HarshitSinghal @NimishAgarwal
|
We (being wannabe''s) created various animations and videos which were apparently cool for that year :P
|
@AnimeshJain @LakshyaSharma
|
and ofcourse our junior wing with @YashGoel
|
All the labour which goes behind this one day of exhib. <br>
@AbhishekGopal @KartikeyGarg @PrashantPal @AakritiHans
|
BTS with @MridulGarg @NikhilAgarwal @ShubamGupta @AdityaGupta
|
Along with the fake candids of IT Team <br> @SidhantKohli @ArchitSareen @NimishAgarwal
|
Happiness after a ''camera'' into school and then the computer lab with @DhanurKhurana @HarshitKumar
|
Some random model probably made just as an excuse to bunk classes <br> @LakshyaSharma @NimishAgarwal @ArchitSareen @DhanurKhurana @YashBhardwaj
|
!!skip!! The final destination: Laurel Falls - this is what we were here for!!
|
With all the fake seriousness to get this clicked <br>
@PushanGupta @ArchitSareen @AmanAgarwal2 @NimishAgarwal

!!raw!!<p id="17" class="center video-container"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Psqp-wPyCrHcjvQXSOm90uQqnSk2-qdt/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">And as the night sets in, the madness of the annual function kicks in.</p></p>
|
Unexposed to the world of concerts, as a 14 year old, this night was our version of concerts!
|
And we became the part of Tech Team, managing all the madness from behind and avoiding all the dance. <br> @ArchitSareen @NimishAgarwal @SidhantKohli @PushanGupta
|
(Future) engineers, awkward infront of camera. <br>@BharatDevGandhi @ArchitSareen @SidhantKohli @HarshitSinghal @PushanGupta @UtkarshBindal

@NamanBhatia @ShiviJain @HiteshRaghuvanshi @RhythmTyagi @AnushkaGoyal @SaumyaAnand @NishantGupta @DakshKohli @VinayakChawla @YashGautam @HarshitKumar @AmanRai

<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">This is probably the only time, when you can break all the possinle rules possible of the school and get still survive unscathed <br> PS: Only censored content is available on this page :P</p></p>
|
But all this time passed quickly like a bubble burst.
|
And most of time went by, sleeping like this.
|
DPSG was madness but also love, and thereby ending this post with an embarrassing photo which probably describes my whole experience: crazy high time!
