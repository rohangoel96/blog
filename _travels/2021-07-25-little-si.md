description: It was peak PNW summer and we were feeling withdrawal symptoms from not doing a hike and missing the summer sun. So I scrambled my hiking boots, called up hiking buddies and decided to summit Little Si - a little sister to Mount Si.

Since it was a last moment plan and we didn''t have a car booked, we chose an innovative way to reach trailhead - Trailhead Direct - a bus service which has created more equitable access to the mountains!

Ugh on-call weekend? But nothing is stopping me from a hike today!!!!
|
We start the hike through this temperate slice of woodlands!
|
And reach the summit quickly, which offers phenomenal views of the valley and surrounding peaks like Mount Si and Mount Washington!
|
Ahh, the satisfaction of not missing a hike weekend!
|
Panoramic views from the summit :)

Fake ass drone shot!
