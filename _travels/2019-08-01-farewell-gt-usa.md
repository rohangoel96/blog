description: Time to start graduate school also meant a lot of goodbyes! I met over 30-40 people over last 2 months and am greatful to all! *sobs uncontrollably*.  <br>PS- I also met a lot of other people but forgot to take pictures! Sorry Divyanshu, Lakshay, Dhanur, GT@Bglore meetup and soooo many more people.
