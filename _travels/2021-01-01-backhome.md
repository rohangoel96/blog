description: After a lot of cancelled plans, I was finally back home in India after about one a half year and in the middle of a pandemic it felt surreal. But I had more than 2 months of holidays, and plans to just stay home and relax :)

my_arr: '
This visit after graduating from GT, will be the longest time I am home after 2014, when I started my undergrad, haha. The plan was to avoid traveling and spend quality time with family! As you''ll realize this trip was mostly about catching up everyone.
|
Grand welcome home, with ''Graduation'' cake.
with @DipanshJain @YashGoel
|
Brought back some ''American'' board games back!
|
(Extended) family bonding as I said. Really miss the childhood in Ghaziabad, where 30+ people parties at home were super common. Re-done for my desh vapsi?
|
Same people at every other gathering ft. COVID!
|
Chilling with parent''s gang?
|
Met some cousins after like what, 10 years?<br>
@VasuAgarwal @AshwinAgarwal
|
And also friends, since 10 years. <br>
@AnugrahPrakash @DhanurKhurana
|
Met people from every time of life - starting from some school friends from DPSG <br>
@LakshaySharma @DhanurKhurana @JhashankGandhi @RisheekMarwah @LakshayGupta @YashVerma
|
And then ofcourse, friends from undergrad at BITS<br>
@DebadityaBasu @IshantGupta @MadhurGarg @ShikharSaluja
|
@SiddhantRathore @AbhinavSingh @ShikharSaluja @DebadityaBasu
|
@AmolSaket @SiddhantRahore
|
And also to the time in France, @JyotiSharma
|
Stayed to Nani''s place after after 5-6 years too, and met the cute little munchkins who have now grown up.
@Mummy @VidushiSinghal @VidyanshiSinghal @AasthaMami
|
And also broke my prized possession - the drone.
|
And soon enough it was time for a (family) new year party. Was home at the new year''s eve after 8 long years - again the first time after I joined BITS. <br>
@YashGoel @Papa @PrabhatMausaji @AnikaRajvanshi @JollyMausi @Mummy @TusharRajvanshi
|
NYE + COVID = Some crazy DIY cocktail!
|
Ofcourse - some new year eve drunk games ...
|
!!GIF!! ... and drunk dance.
|
And some sober ''looking'' dance.
|
I thought I am the champion, and here I lost a chugging competition from (g)oldies.
|
Cheers to the new year!
|
Meanwhile, the best way to start the new year is with a lazy ass golf.
|
Celebrated mummy''s b''day in grandeur and I was physically with her after so so long.
|
Good old housie.
|
Ah, this is how I can summarize my 18 years at Ghaziabad - cricket in the gallery - rain or shine!
|
And some doll''d up photo-ops with family.
|
Then I was also lucky to have a sort of private tour (thanks COVID) of the Coca Cola happiness factory.
|

|
Ah, the songs of Coke Studio <3.
|
Seeing the coke production line ...
|
 ... and tonnes of Coke - childhood dream come true.
|
Along with pure Limca with no adulteration of water or CO2, lol
|
Oh, then finally I was home for my birthday, after 8 long years!
|
Photo-ops
|
Was special and very different to celebrate birthday with family after so very long ...
|
 ... at a jungle theme restaurant for the junglee family, I have.
|
Feeling blessed to share moments with (almost) all first and second degree blood relations
