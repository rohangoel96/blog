description: Monaco is the second smallest and the most densely populated country in the world with over a third of its population being millionaires. Even after multiple land reclamation projects its just over 2km square - the funny part being it's just over 5 times of my otherwise considered tiny college campus. <br>PS- We walked the country's width on foot in less than half an hour.
