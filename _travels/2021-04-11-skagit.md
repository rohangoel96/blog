description: One of the favorite destination events for the Pacific Northwest is the tulip festival in Skagit valley. Every spring hundreds of thousands of people from across the United States and from around the world come to enjoy the celebration of spring as millions of tulips burst into bloom - how could we have missed this?

Boasting tulips of every shade, colour, and variety, the wild parks become the perfect spot to sit and take in the awe and majesty of nature!
|
Historically, the tulip was a symbol of paradise on earth and Skagit valley welcomes you to our modern-day paradise on earth with tulips all around.
|
Along with tulips, the fields of Skagit County burst into bloom with daffodils, a month ahead of the more famous tulips which is a free add-on!
|
Acres of color against a mountain backdrop will dazzle your eyes for sure!
|
Those colorful blooms shake loose the gray days of winter and announce to all that warm summer days are on the horizon.
|
Stripes and stripes of color at fields in Roozengarde - which total more than 1000 acres and 16 acres of greenhouses, are the largest in North America.

The infamous Oysters Bar on the drive provides a perfect pit stop offering stunning views of the San Juan Island from every seat.

A dramatic white arch rises from the green lawns and flowering gardens on the U.S.-Canada border at Blaine and reads  "Children of a common mother" on the USA side, referring to the two nations common origin from the British Empire
