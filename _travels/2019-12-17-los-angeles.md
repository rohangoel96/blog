description: Los Angeles literally translates to "The Angels" from Spanish. Famous for the entertainment industry, the city is just a drive away from snow-capped mountains, desert and beach making it a dream city for me. I was in LA for about 10 days and with so much to see, the time still seemed less :D. Seperate posts for DisneyLand and Universal Studios.
