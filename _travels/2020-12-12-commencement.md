description: Surprisingly, even though it marks the end of college, the graduation ceremony in the USA is called commencement, because it marks the beginning of students new lives in the world - the beginning of their professional life. We consider ourselves lucky that our ceremony was one of the few and first ceremonies happening in COVID times!

Can never forget this date - when I got one degree hotter lol. <br>
Also, note the pronunciation :P
|
Due to COVID, the ceremony shifted was shifted to being a closed door and at the  beautifully decorated McCaimish Pavillion but due to COVID restrictions it was shifted to a socially distant Bobby Dodd ....
|
 ... attended by only a handful. But hey, atleast the ceremony happened so no complaints.
|
The student procession was cancelled and this how mask laden faculty procession look like!

The ceremony started with felicitations from our president Angel Cabrera!

And guess who was the guest of honor? James Quincey, from the Coca Company next door.
