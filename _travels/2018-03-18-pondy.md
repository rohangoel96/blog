description: The largest French Colony in India, Pondicherry, was a nostalgic trip for me - after staying in France for about 4 months. I did try some of the French that I learned - but only to fail :(

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/1.jpg" alt="">After being bored on the west of India, having seen the arabian sea for over 3 years, we decided to go and visit the east coast. Although, the Bay of Bengal is famous as a rough sea, we were awestruck by its beauty at Pondicherry.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/2.jpg" alt="">The promenade was definitely one of the major contributors to the sea's added beauty. Reminded me of the French cities along the coast - which mandatorily had promenades - not so famous in India</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/5.jpg" alt="">Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus showcases a typical gothic style which was very common in the Europe - noticed first time in India.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/6.jpg" alt="">Called as the 'soul of the city', Matrimandir is the centre point of Auroville - an experimental and international township just few kilometres from Pondy.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/7.jpg" alt="">We explored some of the top cafes in Pondi which offered typical Continental Cuisine ;). One must try the 'homemade ginger cake' here at @ArtikaCafe</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/10.jpg" alt="">Unknown to many people, Pichavaram houses one of the largest mangrove forests in the world</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/11.jpg" alt="">The mangrove forests form a sort of a canopy over you, potentially blocking all the sunlight falling on the ground.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/3-pondy/12.jpg" alt="">The trees grow in water that's 3-10 feet deep in different places. The conditions are quite hostile, as the sea's tides bring salt water in and out twice a day, changing the salinity. Hence, the trees have unique root systems, with membranes that only allow fresh water to enter.</p>
