description: We chose Savandurga - the largest monolith in Asia, as our first trek location, after shifting to Bangalore and starting our corporate lives. Situated about 70km from the city it makes a perfect location for an adventurous trek.

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/1.jpg" alt="">A part of the Deccan Plateau and situated at a height of 4220ft the steep slopes are not for the faint-hearted.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/2.jpg" alt="">Waking up at 3AM we hired a zoomcar and started for Savandurga hoping to complete the trek before the sun shines over our heads with its great might.<p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/3.jpg" alt="">The only things one longs for in a road trip: smooth roads, lush flora with a great weather.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/4.jpg" alt="">Pausing on the way and enjoying the view of the dam and the reservoir over the river Arkavathi</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/5.jpg" alt="">This is the terrain that you're greeted with at the base of the hill - it definitely will be one heck of a trek?</p>


<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/6.jpg" alt="">The steep slopes take a heavy toll on legs, esp the knees which makes the trek super challenging and dangerous.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/7.jpg" alt="">That moment of celebration when you are alive after climbing 1/10th of the hill </p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/8.jpg" alt="">Some parts of the monolith seemed almost perpendicular and one couldn't just walk upright without support.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/9.jpg" alt="">Obsessive mid way photography cum rest break?</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/10.jpg" alt="">See those happy faces after reaching the summit? In the backdrop is the Nandi temple which marks the end of the 1.5 hr climb.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/11.jpg" alt="">One can probably see the outskirts of Bangalore from such heights. The strong currents of wind with the amazing weather just made the trek all well worth it.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/12.jpg" alt="">Views from the summit</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/14.jpg" alt="">One needs some time to absorb these serene views of the river and the vegetation.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/15.jpg" alt="">Of those random conversations with the homies, on the summit where one probably contemplates life.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/16.jpg" alt="">One can also see the ruins of the fort built by Kempegowda all across the hill.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2018/7-savandurga/17.jpg" alt="">Difficult to believe but the descend is probably more difficult than the ascend where the chances of slipping increases manifold.</p>
