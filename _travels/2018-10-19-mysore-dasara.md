description: The city of Mysore has a long tradition of celebrating the Dasara festival with grandeur and pomp to mark the festival. The fact that we were just about 150km away in Banagalore, it would have been a sin to miss this.

The illuminated Mysore palace with over 1 lakh bulbs. The palace happens to be the second most visited monument in India after the Taj.
|
Supposedly, more than 11 lakh people attend the dasara celebrations at mysore.
|
The weathermean predicted heavy downpour over the dasara but we were welcomed with scorthing heat. Thankfully, preparing for rains, we brought umbrellas which help against the sun too :)
|
Forming a mesh of umbrellas for some shade in the crowd with no water or space to properly stand.
|
Just look at the insane crowd on both sides of the road where the dasara parade is supposed to happen.
|
And it starts..
|
Jumbo Savari - the marching elephants, carrying the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari - reportedly attended by over 5 lakh people.
|
Random discussions while sitting on the 4-way crossing in between of busy mysuru roads?
|
The whole city and even the streets were decked up with lights for the celebrations.
|
Entery Gate to the Mysore Palace - much beautiful in itself.
|
A temple brightly lit inside the palace''s premises.
|
This illuminated mysore palace is what we were here for :O <br>
Still contemplating on the electricity bills they have to pay for just this single day.
|
Awkward poses.
|
That moment when you successfully capture the palace (reflection :p) and feel like a king yourself. Lulz.
|
Faking candids.
