description: For the extended weekend due to labor day, what's better than a laborious 7-mile adventure in the Chattahoochee National Forest in Northern Georgia?

The hike gives an opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of the city while maintain social distance courtesy: COVID-19. A pleasant surprise is that, as soon as you exit your car, you can hear the sounds of the creek below which is refreshing!

!!GIF!! The hike follows its namesake waterway downstream, diving into a young, mossy hardwood forest.
|
The hike packs a lot of terrain and altitude change.
|
We walked on flat lands perfect for camping ...
|
!!GIF!! ... and also climbed uphill quite a few times!

|
We jumped over fallen trees ...
|
 ... and crossed the stream multiple times! Sometimes on jumping rocks ...
|
 ... and other times using the bridge while posing!

|
And finally cut through the North Georgia mountains to reach our destination -
|
The beautiful multi-tiered Panther creek waterfalls!

|
We underestimated the 12km hike and it got a little late to head back ...
|
 ... it kept getting darker and darker ...

<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">until a point where it was pitch dark and super scary with all the wild animals!</p></p>
|
But guess the upside? With no light pollution, I saw the most star studded sky (yet!)
