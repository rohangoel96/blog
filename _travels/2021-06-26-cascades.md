description: With glacier-clad peaks rising almost vertically from thickly forested valleys, the North Cascades are often called the American Alps. With us skipping any sorts of hike, it was a pure road trip, winding our way through jagged mountain peaks, rocky spires, rushing waterfalls and alpine glacier on the North Cascades Scenic Byway.

North Cascades is highly underrated and one of the least visited parks in the national park system of USA. But it''s so close to us so why miss any, huh? With more than  300 glaciers, the national park has the most glaciers in contiguous US.
|
Northern Cascades Scenic Byway - of all the passes that traverse the Cascades, this is the most mountainous, with high hairpin turns and jaw-dropping vistas. Itâ€™s so rugged, it closes during winter months.
|
Just look at the sheer beauty and the pattern. Is it a glitch in the matrix?
|
Approximately 90 percent of Seattle''s electricity is provided by hydroelectric plants, and this is Gorge Dam, the first of the three dams associated with Seattle City Light''s Skagit River Hydroelectric Project!
|
The second stop on the road trip: Gorge Creek Falls - water falling 242 feet down the mountain before entering Gorge Lake
|
And I just standing over a waterfall?
|
Liberty Bell Mountain towering over the Washington Pass - highest point of the North Cascades Highway
|
The peak is named after the famous, cracked Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol that is inextricably bound up with the quest for American independence
|
And then finally, the highlight and final stop of our trip: Diablo Lake
|
The lake is famous for the turquoise hue which is attributed to the surrounding glaciers that grind rocks into a fine powder (glacier flour) that is carried into the lake through creeks.
|
And since this was the day of the <a href="https://www.historylink.org/File/21266#:~:text=On%20the%20first%20day%20of,cooling%20centers%20for%20their%20use%2C" target="_blank"> HISTORIC HEATWAVE</a> which roasted the entire PNW, we thought why not try ice cold waters?
|
Quickly realizing that the numbing recently melted glacier water is not for the faint hearted!
|
You can clearly see the suspended glacier flour, now can you?
|
Yes, atleast, we can!
|
Acting cool, as if those glacier water are not freezing me to death - all for the gram.
|
The fog setting in made the picture just more divine!
