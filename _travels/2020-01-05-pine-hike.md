description: What's a more refreshing way to start the semester, month, year and decade with a hike! Located not too far from the GT campus and nestled amongst the mountains in Northern Georgia is the scenic hike of Pine Mountain.

my_arr: '
Starting from the West Trail head with the plan of completing just the West Loop (about 5 miles) - we ended up completing the east loop as well with total hike distance well over 10 miles.

Owing to occasional wrong turns :o
|
The thing I liked the most was, how the trail was well maintained yet very very raw and natural!
|
New to the fall season, I actually appreciated the beautiful views, the foliage all across the mountain floor created.
|
with occasional sunshine making the forest glitter like gold

That moment of happiness on reaching the peak...
|
...which offers scenic views of Downtown Atlanta, Stone Mountain and the Kennesaw Mountain.

|
Sun day = fun day?
|
Some parts of the trail were near the 19th-century railroad bed with lot of remains still present, likely destroyed during Civil War?
|
Mirror *_*
|
Ending the trail with Etowah River Valley ...
|
and memories of the glorious pine trees all around!
