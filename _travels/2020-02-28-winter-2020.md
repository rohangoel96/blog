description:  Coming from the Indian subcontinent, even Atlanta's winter with sub zero temperatures is uncomfortably cold for me! This gives us a super chilly start to a new 'Spring Semester' and probably the coldest New Year''s eve yet.

During the start of the ''Spring'' semester, going (read walking) to classes was a huge task! Just looking at this picture gives me chills!
|
And not to forget the rains which made the weather less inhabitable but surely made the campus look splendid!
|
Ofcourse we had some clear and normal days too :P
|
I also officially started as Graduate Research Assistant this semester and got a desk at Coda ...
|
 ... which is my absolute favorite place on campus!
|
It also offers amazing views of ...
|
 ... midtown region and ...
|
 ... has cool areas to play around!

Another blurry night, for the love of Bollywood even in USA and color black!<br>

!!GIF!! The largest aquarium in the world from its opening in 2005 until 2012, Georgia Aquarium is now the third largest aquarium in the world and the largest in the western hemisphere!
|
Known for their agility and playful social behavior, the acts performed by aquarium''s bottlenose dolphins are spectacular to say the least and takes your heart away!
|
!!GIF!! The aquarium is famous for the whale shark: the largest known extant fish species. The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate.
|
!!GIF!! Pacific sea nettle are one of the true jelly fishes!
