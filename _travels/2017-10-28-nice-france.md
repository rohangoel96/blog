<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/cover.jpg" alt="">Nice was definitely the 'nice'st part of the infamous French Riveria with it's pebble beaches - something which totally amazed me. <br>PS: Had to climb 300 stairs for this amazing view</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/1.jpg">Pebbles <3</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/2.jpg">Like any other French city</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/3.0.jpg">Do you see the harbour there?</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/3.jpg">See it now? :D</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/4.jpg">When you have only one jeans and you don't want it wet + pebble beaches are not so comfortable for your legs :(</p>
