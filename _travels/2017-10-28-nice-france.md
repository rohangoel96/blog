Located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast. This coastline was one of the first modern resort areas. It began as a winter health resort for the British upper class at the end of the 18th century.

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/cover-min.jpg" alt="">Nice was definitely the 'nice'st part of the infamous French Riveria with it's pebble beaches - something which totally amazed me. <br>PS: Had to climb 300 stairs for this amazing view</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/1-min.jpg">Pebbles <3</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/2-min.jpg">Like any other French city</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/3.0-min.jpg">Do you see the harbour there?</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/3-min.jpg">See it now? :D</p>

<p class="center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/2017/10-nice/4-min.jpg">When you have only one jeans and you don't want it wet + pebble beaches are not so comfortable for your legs :(</p>
