description: Okay so its Winter in Washington but hey it's a sunny day and that means hiking day!! While the entire trail is 29.6 miles long, we opted to take the shorter Icicle Ridge loop hike which is around 6 miles and gives us an opportunity to unplug and connect with nature.

One of many hiking trails in Leavenworth and nestled in the Cascade Mountains, this popular hiking trail offers picturesque views around every turn. Here’s what you’ll discover when you go!
|
It''s November so snow time, and it makes even random pit stops for oil look so picturesque. 
|
Okay so lets get this snowy hike started!
|
Still a little bit of fall left, but the mostly burnt leaves gave a good contrast to he white washed surroundings.
|
A Seattle resident''s face on a sunny day while on a hike? What else does one want here in the PNW.
|
Keep climbing steadily amongst the snow and soon enough ....
|
 ... we''re greeted with with opens views over Leavenworth. The whole town is clad in snow and looks magical!
|
Slowly and steadily we''ve reached the top ...
|
 ... and can finally see the cascade range in full glory!
|
Before we start the descent, let''s eat something ...
|
 ... and take the view in!
|
And since we''re so nearby, who would miss a visit to the dreamy Leavenworth!
