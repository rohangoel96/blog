description: A trip to Thailand is definitely on the bucket list of every Indian and I was fortunate to do this on my 23rd birthday. The plan was pretty spontaneous with all of us getting leave from work during the same time. In the short 6 days trip we covered all the major tourist spots - Phuket, Krabi and Bangkok.

The Patong beach, the most famous beach in Phuket. We were fortunate to get a stay in Bodega Party Resort, just a 10 mins walk from the beach - enabling us to visit it every day during our stay.
|
First international trip for us, the BPGCians..
|
Bangla Road - the notorious heart of all Phuket Nightlife.
|
The half a km, only walking road presents the tourists literally everything from normal bars, music bars, go-go bars, ping pong shows and the flamboyant lady boys.
|
The Tiger Club - one of the largest I have ever seen with over 60 beer bar counters.
|
Our first trip from Phuket was to the Phang Nga Bay on a Big Boat. <br>Yeh Phang Nga Bay, mera hai and main yahan ka Jaikant Shikre!
|
A distinctive feature of Phang Nga Bay are the sheer limestone cliffs that just vertically come out of the emerald-green water.
|
Koh Panyee - a surprising muslim fishing village almost entirely built on stilts.
|
Post cards from Phang Nga Bay?
|
The James Bond Island from the fame of the James Bond movie ''The Man with the Golden Gun''.
|
Phang Nga Bay is the most popular sea kayaking tourist destinations in southern Thailand and how could we have missed it?
|
Some more shots while kayaking ...

|
Exploring the limestone karsts from close.
|
The area is filled with spectacular caves which you can only reach by kayaks.<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BuyfBvMn_Ep/" target="_blank">See video here.</a>
|
In the ice cream cave, we entered into an area of total darkness. There were spots where you have to lay down completely flat to get under.
|
Our Hostel
|
Second trip to the wallpaper worthy Phi Phi Islands on a speed boat.
|
Crystal clear waters, courtesy go pro.
|
Sandwiched between the sky and the sea, eh?
|
To the delicious lunch at the private island of Koh Yao Yai.
|
Pileh Lagoon - The pristine crystal clear waters surrounded by green mountains provided the perfect setting for birthday dive into the sea. The super salty waters make it easy to swim.<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BuOEpQMncw2/" target="_blank">See video here</a>
|
View of the stunning corals on the sea bed while snorkelling near the Pileh Cove.

|
I so much wish we had time and money to do scuba diving, but alas, only snorkelling it was... which was worth every penny though.
|
To the street we had to ''go go'' twice.<br> With @DebadityaBasu @VarunGoyal @ArnavVijayakar @Ankit
