description: Lake 22 trail, might just be the most beautiful trail in washington and the trail is truly something incredible and is a loop youâ€™ll never forget! We strategically came to the trek to see some snow on/near the lake but not too much of snow as it will just make the trek difficult!

my_arr: '
The origin of Lake Twentytwo''s name is uncertain, but a theory suggests that nineteenth-century railroad maps listed local creeks numerically; one particular creek and its source lake were assigned 22 and this name just stuck!
|
Just at the trailhead itself you''re greeted with the cedar GIANTS!
|
Okay, let''s start the trail, shall we?
|
There is always "water on trail" here, but the dampness allows ferns and moss to flourish in the Mountain Loop rainforest!
|
The trail takes you through different sceneries, from rush green rainforests ...
|
 ... to over the creek and it''s waterfall!
|
Substantial effort has gone into building a trail that can withstand the perpetual beating from the arch-enemy of all trails - water. TBH this has been the most well kept trail I''ve been on which is astonishing!
|
The middle part becomes rocky - super painful but
|
 ... offers great views of Whitehorse Mountain and Three Fingers!
|
And before long we were back on water again and were able to see the first snow.
|
But soon enough, it turned into a winter wonderland. And god I actually ate a lot of snow/ice which was so FRESH!
|
And then FINALLY, we were welcomed by the Lake 22 and we marvelled at the sheer northern face of Mount Pilchuck!
|
!!GIF!! And believe it or not, we also witnessed a loud booking avalanche on the mountain. Apparently, it does happens (non-so-frequently) in winter and spring! How lucky to see it (and survive?)
|
How serene can a frozen lake be?
|
!!GIF!! Did my fair share of adventure by "walking" on a lake!
