description: Moving along from Vermont in our New Englang road trip, the next state to conquer is New Hamsphire which is home to the White Mountains which we heard have HIT PEAK COLORS! Fall in New Hampshire is a foliage lover’s dream come true

my_arr: '
There are few places in the entire world where fall is so spectacular and each year, New Hampshire draws millions of visitors to see the color show. This out during the unique weeks of weather here, when the variety of trees undergo colorful transformation in the rugged terrain.
|
So let''s get done with the last leg of ''leef peeping'' adventure and complete the road trip!
|
Our first stop is the beautiful Echo Lake in Franconia State Park, at an elevation of 1,931 feet, offers views of Mt. Lafayette and Cannon Mountain.
|
In the wild since so long but haven''t done a hike yet? Let''s summit bald mountain and reach Artists Bluff!
|
Photographers can''t afford to miss Artists Bluff, a rocky observation platform providing stunning views over Echo Lake and beautiful autumnal foliage. One of the best places to see the foliage from top (if you don''t have a drone :P)
|
From the summit along you can see vibrant colors along the Franconia Notch which is a spectacular mountain pass!!
|
Driving through 30 winding miles of unbroken White Mountain forest on the Kancamagus Highway (aka “The Kanc”) in Fall is major bucket list item.
|
The drone shots give a totally different perspective of the beauty from the top with endless rolling hills illuminating with radiant reds, burnt oranges, golden yellows and emerald greens
|
Catching the peak colors was an emotional moment for me since so much planing and luck had to play it''s part. The autumn colors are formed as the days grow shorter and the nights become cooler, the chlorophyll break down as the trees stop producing the food. 
|
BUT how vibrant the colors will be depends on other chemical processes. For example, the brilliant red of the maples depends on how much sugar is produced in the leaves and trapped in the chill of an autumn night. The more sugar that accumulates, the brighter red the leaves turn. And how vivid the colors will be depends on the warm sun and rain. And we''re so so lucky to see them at their top glory despite all these possibilities!
|
White mountains is truly truly magic. See the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW5ATyxFOwE/" target="_blank">drone compilation here</a>
|
Lower Falls is the perfect example of a low running river later in the season, but it is still incredibly pretty with bright contrasting colors in the surrounding trees.
|
Covered bridges are famous in New Hampshire, Vermont and all of New England for that matter so how can we miss the Albany Covered bridge here?
|
Finally, away from the colors we decided to pay a visit to U.S.S. Albacore which was once the future of underwater combat, but now this old sub is open for visitors to muck around in. 
|
The insides are a marvel of efficiency or a claustrophobic nightmare but whatever you say, 55 men somehow lived in it for months.
|
Ahoy sailors!!
|
Looking back, the whole foliage trip starting from <a href="/blog/berkshires" target="_blank">Berkshires</a> to <a href="/blog/vermont" target="_blank">Vermont</a> and then here in New Hamsphire was a dream come true to me and these unparalleled vibrant bright colors will be missed! I can''t stop but feel so lucky to see nature flaunting colors at it best!
|
Been the alone driver this had been a test of driving skills but heck, I''ll do it every month if given a chance. For now, let''s go to <a href="/blog/boston" target="_blank">Boston</a> and culminate the adventure we''re on!
