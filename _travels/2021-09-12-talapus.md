description: Encompassing area close to 400k acres, The Alpine Lakes Wilderness got its name from the 700+ mountain lakes found amongst the majestic rocky peaks and densely forested hillsides of the central Cascades. With about 50 official trailheads and 600+ miles of backcountry trails in the area, we managed to find a trail to see 2 of the many lakes along with some solitude time.

 The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canadaâ€“US border by 10,000 years ago. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Being late into the season, it wasn''t the most clear day to trek but the clouds descending on us like fog sure made the hike much more beautiful.

Lucky to witness some early fall colors with a serene misty backdrop.

Never missing a weird photo-op opportunity haha

And here we reach our first lake - Talapus, tucked in a bowl between Bandera and Pratt Mountain. But hey, we''re not rookie hikers so we pushed through another mile to  reach ...

<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">PNW being PNW, the weather quickly started to go bad with plethora of clouds setting in!</p></p>

The most special part about the hike was probably the secluded time we got and it felt like having the whole wilderness to ourselves
