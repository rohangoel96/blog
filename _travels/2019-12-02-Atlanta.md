description: Atlanta, the capital of the US state of Georgia is my temporary home for about 2 years during my Master's. The ignorant me never cared about the city before GeorgiaTech happened. As it turns out, the city is quite integral and important part of the economy and culture with HQs of Coca Cola, CNN, ATT, BoFA and having hosted Summer Olympics even before I was born.

Unexpected colors of "Fall" in Atlanta

Atlanta being so down south, I was not expecting the fall colors but this was a pleasant surprise.

My pilgrimage to World of Coca Cola! Tons and tons of coke has finally paid off!

Atlanta is the home of Coca Cola and the museum was inspired to serve as a continuation of Coca-Cola history dating back to 1886

Tasting over 100 flavors of soda that coke produces around the world at one single place! Worth every penny!
|
The museum also featured a fully functional production plant which was recently closed citing costs and now runs in simulation.
