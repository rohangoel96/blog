description:  Just across Georgia's border lies Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. It is a vacation playland with famous beaches and great golf courses that overlook the Atlantic Ocean. However during COVID-19 times, the fun was ofcourse super limited. Our trip was mainly about the drive, and probably to get some fresh air after ending our internships!

<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">Approximately 300 miles from Atlanta, the trip to Hilton Head from Atlanta although long was pretty scenic!</p></p>

However, before we reached the shore, we did a quick detour to Bonaventure Cemetery which I missed during my <a href="https://rohangoel.com/blog/savannah"/>previous trip to Savnannah</a>!
|
It''s the city''s largest municipal cemeteries, containing nearly 160 acres :O

Also, due to COVID-19, there was less than normal rush and we finally able to eat at the famous Leopold Ice cream! Frequently rated among the country''s best ice cream shops, it was founded in 1919!
|
And if the pandemic wasn''t enough we were also fighting for black rights at the same time!
|
After surviving the worst year in recent history!
|
We initially tried the most "famous" Coligny Beach, only to realize that it''s not the best idea when we want to social distance as more famous means more people ...

.. thus we quickly drove to Burkes Beach and it was a pleasant surprise and very sparsely populated

<p class="center" style="margin-top:-20px;">What happens when you have a wind storm forming for next day and there are not many people on the beach!</p></p>

To be honest, it''super weird to have see the sun not setting in the ocean - perils of living on the east coast :(

Memories shared with @AnshulVora @RajatBhavnani and coronavirus!
