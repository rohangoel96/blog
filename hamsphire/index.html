          <div class="image-caption"> Catching the peak colors was an emotional moment for me since so much planing and luck had to play it's part. The autumn colors are formed as the days grow shorter and the nights become cooler, the chlorophyll break down as the trees stop producing the food. </div>

          <div class="image-caption"> BUT how vibrant the colors will be depends on other chemical processes. For example, the brilliant red of the maples depends on how much sugar is produced in the leaves and trapped in the chill of an autumn night. The more sugar that accumulates, the brighter red the leaves turn. And how vivid the colors will be depends on the warm sun and rain. And we're so so lucky to see them at their top glory despite all these possibilities! </div>
