        <title>Wonderful Wallace Falls</title>
        <description>We can never predict what we would encounter on our travels. This one in particular comprised of a series of three major waterfalls on the Wallace River â€“ called Lower, Middle, and Upper â€“ as well as some intermediate cascades along the way. The magical aspect however was not just seeing the waterfalls, but a surprisingly magical view of Olympics during the hike.</description>

        <title>Stellar South Oregon</title>
        <description>It&apos;s new year&apos;s eve and a long weekend. How can we not utilize and make it special. We initially planned to explore east Oregon but given hazardous snow conditions we changed our plans to south oregon and it couldn&apos;t have been more special. We played on snow, drove ATV on sand dunes, chilled on beaches and hiked through redwood rainforests - can it get more diverse?</description>

        <description>Okay so its Winter in Washington but hey it&apos;s a sunny day and that means hiking day!! While the entire trail is 29.6 miles long, we opted to take the shorter Icicle Ridge loop hike which is around 6 miles and gives us an opportunity to unplug and connect with nature.</description>

        <title>Numinous NYC</title>
        <description>Sometimes been called the capital of the world, New York City is definitely the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world. From Bollywood to Hollywood, I&apos;&apos;ve grown up seeing the city so much on screen that I had been looking to visit it in person for over alteast 10 years! Even after coming to the USA in Aug 2019, I had to wait for over 2 years to finally visit this, and it was nothing short of a surreal and emotional experience!</description>

        <title>Vibrant Vermont</title>
        <description>The beauty and splendor of a Vermont autumn has attained mythical status when it comes to sightseeing, atmosphere and must-do adventures. I had obsessed over foliage colors for more than a year with my first tryst with it at smokey mountains, and now coming to Vermont just taking my obsession to next level, with me micro-planning things and tracking foliage reports for over 2 months daily - just to catch &apos;peak colors&apos;. Finally, the time was here and I&apos;d say we reached at a pretty good time with thrilling carpet of colors blanketing the mountains, forests, and fields!</description>

        <description>A New England Fall trip was on the top of my travel since forever. And this region is totally MADE for the autumn season, and every fall activity you could dream of can be found here, with a backdrop of brilliant foliage and quaint little towns. Finally, stars aligned and I was starting the long trip around the country side from the rolling hills of Massachusetts&apos;&apos;s Berkshires, along with the highest point in the state - Mount Greylock!</description>

        <description>It&apos;&apos;s late September with not a lot of sunny days, so when we saw the weather prediction of a clear cloudless day - a hike was a no brainer.

So we woke up 3am in the morning, hoping to catch Sunrise at the aptly named Sunrise Region in Mount Rainier National Park!</description>

        <title>Fabulous Vegas</title>
        <description>Set in the middle of the Mojave desert of Nevada, Las Vegas- the Entertainment Capital of the World, can seem unreal at first sight - it is a prime example of man&apos;s stubbornness to build this mammoth of a city in super inhospitable environment.  Nicknamed Sin City, Las Vegas and its surrounding communities are famed for their mega-casino resorts, often lavishly decorated with names and themes meant to evoke romance, mystery, and exotic destinations</description>

        <title>Zion Narrows</title>
        <description>The final stop in our American south west trip was the mecca of desert slot canyons - The Zion Narrows, which has been rated one of the top ten hikes on Earth, and rightfully so. It is Zion National Park&apos;s hallmark hike. Here 18 million years of river erosion has cut 1500-foot walls into the earth and for many, hiking The Narrows is a life-changing experience.</description>

        <title>Bryce Amphitheater</title>
        <description>Hoodoos (irregular columns of rock) exist on every continent, but here in Bryce Canyon, which technically is not a canyon, is the largest concentration found anywhere on Earth. It is a series of natural amphitheaters or bowls, carved into the edge of the high Paunsaugunt plateau.</description>

        <title>Antelope Canyon Kayak</title>
        <description>The Antelope Canyon is arguably one of the most famous slot canyons in the world. The  incredible canyon has been created over millions of years by the relentless forces of water and wind, slowly carving and sculpting the sandstone into forms, textures, and shapes which we observe today</description>

        <description>Surprisingly, even though it marks the end of college, the graduation ceremony in the USA is called commencement, because it marks the beginning of students new lives in the world - the beginning of their professional life.

        <title>Lavish Los Angeles</title>
        <description>Los Angeles literally translates to &quot;The Angels&quot; from Spanish. Famous for the entertainment industry, the city is just a drive away from snow-capped mountains, desert and beach making it a dream city for me. I was in LA for about 10 days and with so much to see, the time still seemed less :D. Seperate posts for DisneyLand and Universal Studios.</description>

        <title>Fall @ GaTech</title>
        <description>The first semester is coming to an end - everyone is busy studying with the campus being deserted. But luckily, I don&apos;t have exams this semester - giving me the perfect opportunity to capture pictures of the campus with minimal disturbance by other creatures.</description>

        <title>Unexpected Atlanta</title>
        <description>Atlanta, the capital of the US state of Georgia is my temporary home for about 2 years during my Master&apos;s. The ignorant me never cared about the city before GeorgiaTech happened. As it turns out, the city is quite integral and important part of the economy and culture with HQs of Coca Cola, CNN, ATT, BoFA and having hosted Summer Olympics even before I was born.</description>

        <title>Grinding Grad School</title>
        <description>Everyone knows and expects that graduate school is tough, but trust me that it&apos;s harder and stressful than you think it is. Very different from my experience in Europe, colleges in the USA, I guess are probably worth all the hype.</description>

I met over 30-40 people over last 2 months and am greatful to all! *sobs uncontrollably*.  &lt;br&gt;PS- I also met a lot of other people but forgot to take pictures! Sorry Divyanshu, Lakshay, Dhanur, GT@Bglore meetup and soooo many more people.</description>

        <description>A trip to Thailand is definitely on the bucket list of every Indian and I was fortunate to do this on my 23rd birthday.

        <title>Arduous Kodachadri</title>
        <description>After being postponed a hundred times and amid the risk of a cyclone, we the &quot;fresh graduates&quot; at Tesco Bengaluru set our minds to scale the Kodachadri Hill. The Kodachadri trek is probably one of the best treks in the Western Ghats which offers a 16km one-way hike, flat grasslands, waterfalls, jeep ride and the amazing view of the Arabian Sea - all wonderfully packed in one adventure.</description>

        <description>Okay so I don&apos;t typically do this, but I met such nice and kind people here and I miss them so much that I really need to do this post. I have learned so much from each one of them. I am not much of a selfie person and that&apos;s probably the reason that I don&apos;t have a picture with eveyrone I met BUT if we met in Montpellier, trust me that you have inspired me in some way or the other. THANK YOU  so much (and sorry if we didn&apos;t click a picture together :( ) &lt;br&gt;WIll miss everyone.</description>

I couldn&apos;t travel outside of Ireland (even to the northern part :() thanks to the visa restrictions, but I am proud to have travelled a lot in Ireland and made so many new friends. I&apos;ll surely miss the super hospitable and ever smiling nature of the Irish. It was a great experience, both at work and culturally.
