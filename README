bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Local test environment showing the drafts as if they were published:

## Using the Instagram downloader script
1. In the root directory of this project, set up a Python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
2. Run the script.  Use -u flag for username (defaults to "goelrohan" if not provided), -p or "INSTA_PASSWORD" env variable for password, and -c to provide an authenticator code if 2-factor is enabled.
```
python3 get_data.py -u <username> -p <password> -c <code>
```
3. Media is downloaded to the `img` directory, blog posts are saved to the `_drafts` folder. Edit the post and move to `_travels` to publish the post.
4. Deactivate virtual env when necessary.
```
deactivate
```
