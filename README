## Running Jekyll
Local test environment:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Local test environment showing the drafts as if they were published:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

## Using the Instagram downloader script
1. In the root directory of this project, set up a Python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
2. Run the script.  Use -u flag for username (defaults to "goelrohan" if not provided), -p or "INSTA_PASSWORD" env variable for password, and -c to provide an authenticator code if 2-factor is enabled.
```
python3 get_data.py -u <username> -p <password> -c <code>
```
* Add post by date - There is a new flag on the script -d or --date that you can put in a YYYY-mm-dd date and it will override the exclusion list to get any posts from that date. It goes through the regular nickname/slug prompt once it finds a post/posts for that date.
* Option to change post date - I didn't want to make the interactive script too cumbersome with a lot of prompts, so as it prompts you for the nickname/slug, you can input an optional date, separate by a comma e.g. "athens,2025-01-01" or you could just use "athens" to use the date it was posted to Instagram

3. Media is downloaded to the `img` directory, blog posts are saved to the `_drafts` folder. Edit the post and move to `_travels` to publish the post.
4. Deactivate virtual env when necessary.
```
deactivate
```
